# snort_clientserver

Originally an example of a multithreaded Client/Server connection, I modified it to flood the server with requests.
Limited to a few hundred requests at a time because I didn't want AWS to flag my traffic as malicious and risk losing
another server ( I took down a few by accident doing other things for this project)
